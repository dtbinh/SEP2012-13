\end{center}

The NXT Archeology robot consist of LEGO units. There are several parts that are important to the robot. 

\section{Ultra Sonic sensor}
The ultrasonic sensor is installed at the front of the robot. It is used to detect the obstacle at the front, left and right. It can also locate the wall by ultrasonic, thus when robot find a wall, it will be displayed on the map at the corresponding position. Please note that ultrasonic sensor only finds walls location at manual scan mode and automatic mode. However, in manual control mode, ultrasonic sensor is also turned on. When you are moving towards a wall in manual control mode, robot will stop in a distance before it hits the wall, and you will not be able to move any closer to the wall. This is for preventing from damaging the robot.


\section{Sensor Motor}
Sensor Motor is the motor to turn the ultrasonic sensor left, right or front. To accurately map the walls ultra sensor motor will only turn the sensor to three directions. Please make sure the ultrasonic sensor is facing the front before you start. Because the sensor motor will consider the angle that you started with as front and move accordingly. For example, if the ultrasonic sensor is facing left when you start, sensor motor will not be able to turn left anymore.


\section{Left \& Right Motors}
There are two motors control the robot movement. They are installed at the bottom and connect with wheels. These two wheels are responsible for all the movement of robot including moving forward, moving backward, turn right and turn left. The distance between two wheels is a important parameter of the robot pilot system. Changing the distance may have a effect on accuracy.So please DO NOT change the distance between two wheels by your self. 


\section{Light sensor}
Light sensor which is installed below the ultrasonic sensor is used to discover the hidden wall. On the archeology map, hidden walls are distinct from other area
 in color. Light sensor can tell that which area has different color (usually darker). by that, it can find under-ground walls. Light sensor only turned on in manual scan mode and automatic mode. It can not work on manual control mode.

\chapter{Troubleshooting} % (fold)
\label{cha:troubleshooting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  For the user who is running Mac OS X Mountain Lion, you may having some issues connecting the robot. You can solve this problem by installing a lower version of OS X(ie: OS X Lion 10.7.X) or according to \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/bluecove-users/7jWv1V1GC-4}{this}, try to use the \href{https://bluecove-users.googlegroups.com/attach/8c4cbcadb7aa9e5/IOBluetooth-Lion.tgz?pli=1&view=1&part=4}{blue-tooth framework} of OS X Lion. 

	\item Users who using both 32 bit and 64 bit JRE and JDK may have problem run the program after you compile it. That is because the LejOS library does not support 64 bit JRE and JDK, using the JVM argument ``-d32'' to solve this problem.

	\item Some situations may freeze the robot's server program which you can not reboot the robot by close the host program. Simply remove the robot's battery and put it back in to solve this problem.

\end{enumerate}
