2. We decided to put our touch sensor at the back with a bumper connect to it.\\
3. We think that the ultrasonic sensor should face the front, whenever it detect a wall the robot should stop at a point that is neither too close or too far to the wall.



\subsection{Physical Design}
1. We designed the bumper which connect to touch sensors.\\
2. We improved our design.

\subsection{Code Design And Test}
1. We wrote the code to make our robot move until it hits the wall(our hand) with bumper.\\
2. We tested our design to make sure the robot will stopped by Walls.\\
