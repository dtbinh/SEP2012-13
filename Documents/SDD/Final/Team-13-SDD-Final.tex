\chapter{System Overview}% (fold)
The main goal of the system is to let the robot is able to be used for survey an archaeological site containing the remnants of an ancient city under both automated and manual control.  The robot is not allowed to be damaged during the whole working process. The hardware system is the robot who execute all detection, the software system is used to control the robot and implement information transmission between the Host and Robot. Generally, there are three mainly part for this system: the Host, the Robot and the communicator.  

\section{Robot}
The robot is used to execute the detection of the archaeology in one sized map. The map contains the objects like hidden walls and obstacles, the robot is required to detect all these objects when it searches the map. The robot has the light and ultrasonic sensor which are used to implement the detection operation.     

\section{Host}
The Host is installed on the PC and the function of the Host includes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using GUI to demonstrate the map, include all objects on the map and the robot states.
\item Using Navigation to implement auto and manual control, which is combined with GUI. 
\item Parse the XML file to the data structure which contains the map information.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Communication Component}
The Communication Component is used to connect the Host system with the Robot. It allows the Host to send the command to the robot and robot to send the searching information to the Host. In the whole system, the communication Component is implemented by the Bluetooth. \\ \\
The diagram of communication Component shows below:
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{CommandQueue.png}
  \caption{The communication diagram}
\end{figure}
  
\pagebreak
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the whole system of this project contains three parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Robot is the main body to implement all detection operations. It is also required to return the feedback about map and immediate robot status 
  \item Host is used to implement the controlling of the robot and demonstrate the robot status. The Host also takes responsibility to store(load) the map to(from) XML. 
  \item Communication Component is used to connect the Host with Robot. All transmission of the information has to use the communication part. 
\end{itemize}
With these three parts, the system will work properly and do the task based on the client's requirements and Project Description.

\chapter{System Architecture and Components Design}% (fold)
\label{cha:SACD}
%In this section, you should cover the following content, in several subsections.%


\section{Architectural Description}
The archaeology robot system we make will have three major parts that work together to achieve the goal. These three parts are Host System, Robot System, blue-tooth Connection. The Robot System is mainly used to execute the detection, the Host System is the controlling centre which is used to control the robot and record the information from remote interface. The role of the blue-tooth Connection is to connect the Host System with Robot System. The System connection diagram display below: 
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{System.png}
  \caption{The system connection diagram}
\end{figure}
\section{Component Decomposition Description}
\subsection{Robot System}
The Robot System is installed in the archaeology robot. Basically the Robot System will be implemented all basic functionalities of the robot. Also it is required to respond to commands which are sent from the Host System. Moreover the Robot System should also include functionalities that can make the robot move according to the received command. There are three components in the Robot system:
\paragraph {Server} is used to accept the commands from Host System and send the messages to the Host System. All the messages which will send to Host System need to packet here. All commands sending from Host System also need to unpacked in this server.
\paragraph {Sensor Monitor} include light sensor and ultrasonic sensor. The light sensor is used to detect the hidden walls which will use different colour to mark on the map. The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the obstacles on the map. As the safety priority principle, the robot is forbidden to collide the obstacle, the ultrasonic is the tool to protect the robot. In our design, when ultrasonic detects the obstacles, it will notify the robot, then robot will stop in a few distances front of the obstacle.
\paragraph {Pilot} is used to control the movement of the robot and the detection of the sensors. It is also used to control the rotation of the robot by setting the speed of robot's wheels on both sides.      


\subsection{Host System: }
The main purpose of the Host System is to implement remote controlling of robot. Following the Requirement Description, the robot is required to be controlled by users. It is necessary to build a control panel on PC, then the user is able to control the robot and check the robot status from PC. In our design, the Host System will follow the Model-View-Controller pattern. There are three main parts representing the three components of this pattern: GUI(View), MapStructure(Model), Controller and Navigator(Controller).    
\newline
\paragraph{MapStructure and XML Documents(Model)} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item MapStructure: The Map is composed by pixels. The size of each pixel is 25mmx25mm. The robot search the map using pixel as the unit. The map also need to include the information of all object like hidden walls and obstacles. In addition, some related robot status also is stored in the Map Structure(the current position and the start position of the robot).
\item XML Documents: The map is stored in the XML file. The map information is able to be checked by GUI, and the GUI also can store the map information in XML file.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{GUI(View)} The GUI will contain three components which are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Main GUI: is the graphic interface for the host system which is used to show to the user. The main frame of it has many small components which is able to implement different functions. It includes buttons to control the robot(the movement, speed and mode change), robot status(battery level, current
speed and current position), system status(the bluetooth connection), save, load and create
map(the size and position of the map and no go zones, load(save) the map from(to) database)
and menu(the group introduction). 
\item Map Panel: is a component of the GUI that shows the surveying map. It is used to display
the location of the robot and draw the real map into it, which means the map panel will display
and draw everything the robot explored. After the survey, the map viewer will save the map
into the database if it receives a 'save' command from the host. The map panel also contains
the icon of the map, different colour represents different object on the map, for example, the
red colour represents the no-go zones, the black colour represents unexplored area.
\item Information Window: All operation for the GUI will display on the Information window,
also the Information window shows the brief introduction of every group member.
\end{enumerate}
%Describe the architectural design of the whole system. Typically, you should include a block diagram showing the major subsystems and their interconnec- tions.%
\paragraph{Controller and Navigator(Controller)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Controller: The controller takes responsibility to connect with the robot, the function of controller is similar with the Server, its main function is packeting the commands which send from Host System to Robot System and unpacking  the messages which receive from the Robot System.
\item Navigator: The Navigator has two component, the Auto Scanner and the Manual Scanner. The main function of Navigator is to make the algorithm to control the robot scan the map on auto and manual scan modes. In Auto-scan mode, the Navigator will make the algorithm to let the robot to find path automatically and send all objects of the map to the Host System. On Manual-scan Mode, the Robot is controlled by the user. The user is able to send the command to control the movement of the robot. The safety is priority for both mode, the Navigator is forbidden the user to execute some unsafe operation. For example, if user wants the robot to collide the obstacles or the user wants the robot to access the no go zones, the robot will not move follow the commands. The Navigator is combined with  the GUI.    
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Blue-tooth Connection}
The bluetooth is used to connecting the Host System with the Robot System. All the information transmission need to go through the bluetooth, the bluetooth is wireless so that it will not limit the move range of the robot.

\section{Architectural Alternatives}
%Discuss briefly other architectures that were considered if any.%
The other alternative design which is considered is letting the robot do the exploration without
waiting command from the host system. The idea is shelved because the robot's resource is not capable
of performing the  algorithm.\\ \\
Another architecture we considered was the Object Oriented model. The Java is a object oriented model, meanwhile, the program of the system mainly use java language. OOM is a effective way to use. This model is helpful to let every developer understand each other's work content and process. However, the robot is required to terminate at any time, as the result, this model is not work well effectively. That is the reason why we abandon this model.



\section{Design Rationale}
%Discuss the rationale on selecting the architecture described in 3.1, including the critical issues and trade-off that were considered.%
The design of the system is layer architecture. The model is chosen for its support of separation
and independence. The development is spread across teams with each team being responsible
for a different part. The use of interface allows smooth integration without risk of
 incompatible method calls. If there is change in the interface, only the adjacent layer is affected
 so change is localised.

\chapter{Data Design}% (fold)
\label{cha:DD1}
%You should cover database description and data structures in this section.%

\section{Database Description}
%Describe briefly the database(s) that is part of the system.%
The map is represented in XML format. It is created when the robot starts to explore.The map updates every time when the robot explores an area, detects
a hidden wall or an obstacle of the survey area. The information which is stored in the array is translated
and saved into XML. The XML file can be loaded as well. The detailed functionalities are
as follow:

\paragraph{Creating a map}

The map need to has width, height and coordinates of border. The size of the map is stored as digital number and the coordinates of the border are stored in an array list.

\paragraph{Recording the features of the area}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Clear Area: containing no features and is considered to be safe. The status and coordinate is saved if the area is explored.
\item	 Hidden Wall Area: containing hidden walls.The status and coordinate is saved if the area is explored.
\item  Obstacle Area: containing obstacle.The status and coordinate is saved if the area is explored.
\item  No-go-zone area: the robot is not permitted to enter the area. The status and coordinate is entered by the user.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recording the position of the robot}

The coordinates of current position are stored in an array list and are flagged as visited.

\paragraph{Saving}

The map which is explored so far can be saved.

\paragraph{Loading}

The previous map can be loaded.


\section{Data Structures}
%Give the detailed design of the database, i.e., entities and their relationships. You can use either ER model or UML for this purpose.

\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 4.1: Data Structure} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
The underlying data structure of the map database is a two dimensional array. Each element
is the pixel's information, which is indexed by its coordinating in the map. Each zone(grid)
consisted of the information of its 4 sub-grids, which is stored in a two-by-two array.

\chapter{Design Details}% (fold)
\label{cha:DD2}
%You shall describe your design by using the following diagrams to reflect all the major requirements that you documented in the SRS.%

\section{Class Diagrams}
%Describe all class diagrams that are considered in the system. Give the details (e.g., attributes, operations) associated with the class.%
The class diagrams contain four major components, the Controller diagram, GUI diagram, Navigation diagram and Robot diagram.\\ \\
The controller is responsible for the communication between the robot and the GUI(host system).  The controller allows the host system communicate with the robot by sending commands. The user can send commands from the GUI to the robot also the GUI can receive information from the robot.\\ \\
The GUI is responsible for letting the user to control the robot on host system. The GUI shows everything related to the robot and the result map that robot surveyed. Also the user can change the setting of the robot via GUI.\\ \\
The navigation is responsible for controlling the way that the robot should go. The navigation will guide the robot to go the right way and map out the map between auto mode and manual control mode. \\ \\
The robot(class) is responsible for the basic implementation of the robot. The robot(class) contains basic status of the robot and the default operations of the robot which are used to communicate with the GUI via controller.

\subsection{Controller diagram}
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=18.20cm]{Controller.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.1: Controller Diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
The Controller diagram contains three parts: Operations, CommandTranslator and MainControl thread. The Operation is used to store all default operations for both the robot and the host system. The Command Translator is used to translate the commands which are sent from host system so that the robot can act as the commands tell. The MainControThread is used to communicate between the robot and the host system(sending commands).

 \includegraphics[width=18.20cm]{GUI.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.2: GUI Diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
The GUI diagram contains many classes. The GUI can be used to show the team information, create new map(set the size of the map), save map, load map, set ``no-go'' zone. show the status of the robot, change the setting of the robot(mode, speed) and connect the robot with the host system.

\subsection{Navigation diagram}
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=18.20cm]{Navigation.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.3: Navigation Diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
For the Navigation part, the class PanthFinder has algorithm which provide path for all the scan operations. Two Navigation classes use the path found by PathFinder and then send it to the robot in auto-scan mode and manual-scan mode. The robot will move and scan the map based on the command that Navigation send. The RobotAutoScanner allows the scan operation work automatically. The RobotManualScanner allows the scan operation work manually.

 \includegraphics[width=18.20cm]{Robot.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.4: Robot Diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
The robot diagram has 4 parts: Robot, BluetoothServer, SensorMonitor and Operations. The Robot class is used to store the basic information of the robot which include robot movement, robot status and scan functions. The BluetoothServer is used to connect the robot with the host system and then send back information to the host system. The operations is used to store default operation protocols for the robot. 
\pagebreak

\section{State Diagrams}
%Present the state diagrams of objects involved.%
The state diagrams will cover three major components which include robot state diagram, robot auto scan state diagram and  robot manual control state diagram. For the robot state diagram, it shows the basic states of the robot. The robot auto scan state diagram shows the states of the robot in auto-scan mode. For the robot manual control state diagram, it shows the states of actions of the robot in manual control mode.

\subsection{Robot State Diagram}
Since the robot state diagram is used to describe the basic states of the robot, the initial state of the robot is ``Not Connected''.  The robot will stay at ``Not Connected'' state and wait for any inputs until the user connect the robot with the host system via blue-tooth. When the robot is connected, the control mode will be set to manual mode, which means the robot will stay at ``Manual Mode'' state. After that, the user can change the control mode of the robot between manual mode and auto mode. Moreover, if the robot loss connection at any states, it would go back to the ``Not Connected'' state.
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=13.20cm]{RobotState.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.5: Robot state diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
\pagebreak

\subsection{ Robot Auto Scan State Diagram}
When the robot is connected and in auto-scan mode, the initial state of the robot will be ``Current Pixel'' state.Once the robot stay at ``current pixel'', it will go North/West/East/South base on the navigation and pathfinder. When the robot reach the next pixel, if the pixel is explored, then robot would go back to ``Current Pixel'' state and go to next pixel again. If the pixel is not explored, then the robot will use its light sensor to scan ground and then Scan all-around. After these actions finish, the robot will go back to the ``Current Pixel'' state and keep going until all pixels in the map are explored.
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=13.20cm]{AutoScan.png}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 5.6:  Robot auto scan diagram} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
\pagebreak

\subsection{  Robot Manual Control State Diagram}
When the robot is connected and in manual control mode, the initial state of the robot will be ``Stop'' state because the robot is waiting any inputs from the user via GUI interface. The GUI has six buttons for robot movement so that there are another six states in this diagram (seven in total).  When the user keep pressing the forward button, the robot will stay at ``Forward'' state and move forward. Once the user release the forward button, the robot will stop and back to ``Stop'' state. Moreover, if the ultrasonic sensor detects any walls in front of the robot, it will also stop moving forward and back to ``Stop'' state. The ``Backward'' state, ``Left'' state and ``Right'' state has the same mechanism as ``Forward'' state has. For the rest of the states, if the user press turn left/right 90 degrees button, the robot will turn left/right 90 degrees automatically and then stop, which means the robot will stay at ``Left 90 degrees''/``Right 90 degrees'' during the action of the robot. When the robot is stop, it will go back to the ``Stop'' state.

\label{cha:HID}

\section{Overview of the User Interface}
%Describe briefly the general functionalities of the system from end users? per- spective.%
The Graphical User Interface is used to communicate with the robot. The GUI is connected with robot, the user is able to control the robot by GUI. When the robot finishes its task, the user is allowed to switch off and disconnect with robot. In addition, the GUI demonstrates the status of the robot. The status includes the speed, the power and the location of the robot. The GUI also shows the obstacles, the "no-go" zone and hidden walls, which is able to be checked on the map window.\\

The GUI is able to demonstrate the follow functions for users:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a new map file.
\item Save maps to a XML file
\item Load maps from a XML file
\item Change the control mode (Auto or manual)
\item Connect to the robot via Bluetooth
\item Demonstrate the Blue-tooth connection status and Battery status
\item Control the moving direction of the robot(i.e. forward, backward, rotating)
\item Demonstrate the Icon of the map
\item Demonstrate the Log Information
\item Change the speed of the robot
\item Demonstrate the coordinate of the robot
\item Add "no-go" zones to the map
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 6.14: Icon of the map} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
\subsection{Demonstrate information of the GUI on the log information board}
The Log Information board displays the information of the GUI. For example, the Log Information board demonstrates the version and the developers of the robot. If the user changes the control mode, the board displays which mode it is now. The board also is required to indicate the connection information.
  \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=11.20cm]{board}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\textbf {Figure 6.15: The logging information} \\[0.3cm]
\end{center}
\subsection{Control the speed of the robot}
The GUI includes a speed bar and one specific number to control the speed of the robot. The host is allowed to change the speed of the robot by change the number of the bar. The larger number means the faster the robot is. If the number is zero, it means the robot stops immediately.
  \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=8.20cm]{bar}
