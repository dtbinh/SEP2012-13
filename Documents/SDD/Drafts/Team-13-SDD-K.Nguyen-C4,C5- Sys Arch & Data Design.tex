\section{Architectural Alternatives}
%Discuss briefly other architectures that were considered if any.%
The other alternative design which is considered is letting the robot do the exploration without
waiting command from the host. The idea is shelved because the robot's resource is not capable
of performing the algorithm. 

%Need more details

% Other architectures are considered in the design of the system. One of them we considered is
% to indicate the logically finding a path on the robot itself. Then the robot accesses into the bordered
% areas of the map and detect the objects(mines, obstacles or beacons)in order to perform safe
% and successful mission. This design is scraped on the basis that the robot does not have enough
% memory or processing capacity to store the data and execute the commands efficiently.In another
% design, bordered areas will be represented by a bitmap rather than polygonal shapes. This will
% have simplified the logic involved with clipping and merging zones together as well as navigating
% through the map. However this is inconvenient to save the current map into an XML format file
% and will require converting between polygonal shapes and bitmap formats which is complex. This
% design has a limit on using a bitmap which means a very large map will not be able to represent
% the details or require a large amount of memory.

\section{Design Rationale}
%Discuss the rationale on selecting the architecture described in 3.1, including the critical issues and tradeoffs that were considered.%
The design of the system is layer architecture. The model is chosen for its support of seperation 
and independece. The development is spread across teams with each team being responsible
for a different part. The use of interface allows smooth intergration without risk of 
 incompatible method calls. If there is change in the interface, only the adjacent layer is affected 
 so change is localized.

\chapter{Data Design}% (fold)
\label{cha:DD1}
%You should cover database description and data structures in this section.%

\section{Database Description}
%Describe briefly the database(s) that is part of the system.%
The map is represented in XML format. It is created when the robot starts to explore.The map updates every time when the robot explores an area, detects
a wall or a border of the survey area. The information which is stored in the array is translated
and saved into XML, which can be loaded for later use. The detailed functionalities are
as follow:

\paragraph{Creating a map}

The map is initialised to be a size of a grid, which is two by two.
The size of the map is stored as digital number and the coordinates of the border are stored in an
array list.

\paragraph{Recording the features of the area}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Clear Area: containing no features and is considered to be safe. The status and coordinate
   is saved if the area is explored.
\item	Wall Area: containing walls.The status and coordinate is saved if the area is explored.
\item  No-go-zone area: the robot is not permitted to enter the area. The status and coordinate is 
entered by the operator.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recording the position of the robot}

The coordinates of current position are stored in an array list and are flagged as visited.

\paragraph{Saving}

The map which is explored so far can be saved.

\pargraph{Loading}

The previous map can be loaded,

% The representation of database of the minefield in the host side is represented in XML format. It
% is created when the map on the host side is displayed. It is updated every time when the robot
% explorers a new area, detects a mine, an obstacle or finds a beacons in the minefield. All these
% status are translated into XML and saved in the XML file which can be reloaded for further use.
% The database includes following contents:


\section{Data Structures}
%Give the detailed design of the database, i.e., entities and their relationships. You can use either ER model or UML for this purpose.%
The underlying data structure of the map database is a two dimensional array. Each element
is the zone (grid)'s information, which is indexed by its coordinattiong in the map. Each zone(grid)
consisted of the information of its 4 sub-grids, which is stored in a two-by-two array
