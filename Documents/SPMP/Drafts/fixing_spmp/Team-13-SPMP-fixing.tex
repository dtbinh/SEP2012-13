\chapter{Process model}
The Waterfall Model has been chosen for this project for various reason. The first one is that it has strict deadline which help the team focus on the software delivery on time. On the other hand, the feature of having stable requirements can be very helpful to the team's development. 

\section{Waterfall Model}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\setlength\fboxsep{2pt}
\setlength\fboxrule{0.2pt}
\fbox{\includegraphics[width =0.8\linewidth]{WaterfallModel}}
\caption{The Waterfall Model}
\label{sec:WTF}
\label{fig:WTF}
\end{figure}

The waterfall model is a sequential design model , which has a more simple and disciplined approach. The waterfall model provides a structured development approach. It includes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Requirements
	\item  Design
	\item  Implementation (Coding or construction of the project)
	\item  Validation (Testing or debugging)
	\item  Maintenance
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Waterfall Model Life Cycle}
\paragraph{Requirements}
The requirement phase is the initial stage of the whole life cycle. At the Requirements specification phase, team will perform requirements elicitation based on the project description and the client meetings. All the selected requirements will be listed in the SRS document and implemented during the development phase.

\paragraph{Design:}
The Design phase is the phase that team members to design and establish a project plan. It is essential for the team to design all the aspects of the project carefully, since any changes made in later step will be very difficult to implement.

\paragraph{Implementation:}
Once the entire system is designed properly and completely, the main developers will start to implement the software of the project at this phase. Proper SRS documents and plans at earlier phases will be helpful. 

\paragraph{Validation:}
After the implementation is done, the QA engineers will start the Validation phase, involving testing the overall system and ensuring all requirements have being achieved. The tests include to detect whether the system is working as the previous plan.

\paragraph{Maintenance:}
After the first release of the software, the team will need to maintain the system and fix possible bugs which would be found by users.

\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Simple and disciplined linear software process flow.
	\item  Well written documentation will be produced earlier in the software life cycle.
	\item  Software release to the client on deadline.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Unable to adopt change during development
	\item  Heavy documents
	\item  Late discovery of technical problems.
	\item  Can not have working software until the end of the development.
	\item  Testing is only completed at later stages of the project .

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Minimize the Negative Impact}
The waterfall model is a one way model, which is not allowed to make much change on the later phase. In order to overcome some disadvantages and minimise the potential risk of the Waterfall Model, developers need to apply the following improvements to the Waterfall Model.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  In order to avoid changes after the Requirements phase, the requirements stage will require well documented questions and answers from the client. Any unclear features of the project must be dealt with immediately by appropriate confirmation from the client during the client meetings.
	\item  During the design phase, all components of the system need to be properly managed and designed with the correct requirements. In this stage, developers use one Gantt chart to ensure against any setbacks to the project. It is essential to use the risk plan to avoid and fix any issues.
	\item  Documentation manager need to keep all the documents up to date, and adapt to the requirements changes.
	\item  The implementation stage should not be started until all features are well designed and negotiated by all team member. It is necessary to record all potential issues to prevent any change of from previous phase. It is also essential to release the working prototypes to the client frequently in order to gather more feedbacks from the client.  
	\item  During project validation, the system needs to be tested thoroughly. It is required to test the system by all team members, more test will be helpful to fix more bugs. 
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Supporting plans}

\section{Configuration management plan}
The configuration management plan demonstrates the basic plan about how we manage our project properly. It is important and necessary to make sure all items related to client's requirement are under control of the developers. The configuration management plan is also an approach to track the development and history of each developer's task. In our project, we mainly use the SVN control repository and File Folder for configuration management. The following is the specific explanation and structure of SVN and File Folder. 

\subsection{SVN Control Repository}
Since every developer's documents and codes are saved in SVN control repository, it is convenient to check everyone's contribution to the project by client. SVN is also working as a database which is used by developers to look up the process and modification of each one.\\ \\
Then team members are able to understand the newest version of the documents and codes as soon as possible. Each group member has right to upload, download, check and modify(include delete) the files in SVN repository.\\ \\
Here is the structure of SVN Repository:
\paragraph{1. SEP-Group13-Code:}
This folder is used to save all code related to control the robot and PC  in this project. 
\paragraph{2. SPMP draft:}
This folder is used to store all versions(except final version) of Software Project Management Plan report.

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item different versions of PDF draft
 	\item different versions of TEX draft 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{3. agendas}
This folder contains the agendas of the Client Meeting and Internal Meeting.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Team-13-InternalMeeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda.pdf
	\item Team-13-InternalMeeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda.tex
	\item Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda.pdf
	\item Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda.tex
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{4. code samples}
This folder is used to collect all test codes for this project.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item GUI
	\item BTRobotServer
	\item Robot Movement
	\item test-codes
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5. Documents}
This folder is used to store the final version of documents.
\paragraph{6. SRS draft}
This folder is used to save all versions(except final version) of Software Requirement Specification report 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item different versions of PDF draft
 	\item different versions of TEX draft 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{7. minutes}
This folder contains the minutes of the Client Meeting and Internal Meeting.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Team-13-InternalMeeting-"times of the meeting"-Minutes.tex
	\item Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Minutes.pdf
	\item Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Minutes.tex
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{File Folder}
File Folder is used to collect all materials which is printed out(including the minutes and the agendas). The feedback and the draft documents are also saved in the file folder. By using file folder, the client is easy to understand the progress of the project and is convenient to mention more requirements for us in every meeting.\\ \\
The file folder is also used as a summary for every week in internal meeting. We use folder to record the complete part and incomplete part of the project. By this way, it is convenient for us to change the time schedule for every week.   

\section{Documentation plan}
The project requires the group to produce professional quality documentation by using LATEX. All documents should use this format and it is necessary to store all documents in pdf and tex format in SVN repository. The structure of each document is required to base on the template which is post on the CS forum. For every document, we will use "divide and merge" method, which means every document is divided to different components, each group member takes responsibility to their own part. Then each group member gives a short presentation about what they write and how they plan in every week's internal meeting.

The Required documents include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Poster} } The poster is used to demonstrate the personal information of each group member including the position and the main job of each one in this project. The client is able to use poster to understand each group member's strengths and weakness.
	\item{\textbf{Software Requirements Specification} } The purpose of these documents is to describe the tasks what need to do to reach the client's requirements. In these documents, it is also necessary to demonstrate the allocation of tasks to each group member. The client also requires analysing the potential risks and demonstrating how to avoid and solve all these risks. 
	\item{\textbf{Software Design Document} } The purpose of this report is to provide an overall architecture model of the project. In addition, we are also required to give a brief introduction on individual component task. In this document, it is necessary to use some diagrams to demonstrate the design of the whole project. 
	\item{\textbf{User Manual} } The purpose of this document is to provide a guidance and instruction sheet to the client to show them how to control this whole system. In this document, the developers need to consider that some users do not have professional knowledge related to this project.
	\item{\textbf{Group Milestones} } The milestone is used to demonstrate the progress of the project to client. For writing this document, the group members need to negotiate the working process in the internal meeting. The milestone is able to be renegotiated by discussion.
	\item{\textbf{Minutes} } The purpose of the minutes is to record the working progress and client's requirement in each meeting, The minutes are divide as client meeting minutes and internal meeting minutes. The client meeting minutes are used to record the new requirement from the client, the internal meeting minutes are used to record the content of group members' discussion.
	\item{\textbf{Agendas} } The agenda is used to schedule the process of each meeting(client meeting and internal meeting). The client is convenient to understand what hope to be demonstrated by developer in every meeting.
	\item{\textbf{Testing report} } The purpose of this document is to ensure that all students participate the testing process for the software development. Every group member is required to write a testing report to demonstrate some test case.  
\end{enumerate}
     


\section{Quality assurance plan}
\subsection{Verification and Validation process}
Each group member is required to review and check the documents and codes which are written by other group members. It is necessary to make a standard including how to write the documents and the codes. In addition, we offer the position as spell checker and code checker to check and fix every document and code to make sure the documents and codes are written as the standard. If the documents or codes is too hard to understand or do not follow the standard, the checks is able to ask the developers to rewrite the documents or codes. In internal meeting, the checkers have the responsibility to demonstrate the final version to the rest developers to do the double checking together.
\subsection{Standard}
\paragraph{Coding standard}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item When the developers build the Java Folder, the developers are required to use the function of this Java program as the folder name. For example, GUI developers are required to name the folder as GUI, the robot developers are required to name the folder as Movement or Sensor detection. In this way, other developers are convenient to find the needed Java program.
	\item The developers are required to write the developer's name, writing date and the brief explanation of this file's function on the top of each Java file. This standard is used to make the Java file clearer to be read. Meanwhile, code checkers is more convenient to check the author and the fix date.  
	\item The developers are required to write the specific comments for each method, which is convenient for others to read and save the reading time.
	\item The group members who modify others' program are required to write the name and the fix date on the bottom of the Java file. The modify part is also needed to be labeled.
	\item The standards java code and Javadoc are mainly following the oracle standards. For the specific explanation, please look up the oracle official website.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Documents standard}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The file name of each document(except minutes and agendas) is required to write in format like this: Team-13-document's name-version. The client minutes is required to write in format like this:
	Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Minutes, the internal minutes is required to write in format like this: Team-13-InternalMeeting-"times of the meeting"-Minutes. The internal agenda is required to write in format like this: Team-13-InternalMeeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda. The client agenda is required to write in format like this: Team-13-Meeting-"times of the meeting"-Agenda. 
	\item Each group member is required to understand how to use Latex to write the file. When developers submit the documents, it is necessary to upload both the tex and pdf file.
	\item The documents must be submitted in the correct folder. For example, the minutes have to submit in the minutes folder. It is not allowed to submit the files in the wrong folder. The developer has to make sure the documents submit in right place. 
	\item If one developer wants to delete documents, it is required to negotiate with the other group members. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Testing}

\paragraph{Types of testing}
\begin{enumerate}
  	\item Development Testing: where the system is tested during development to discover bugs
and defects. Consisted of unit testing, component testing and system testing
	\item Release Testing: where a separate testing team test a complete version of the system before it is released to users.
	\item User testing: where the client test the system in their own environment. Occurs in the presentation
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{How the test is run}
The code is tested bit by bit by JUnit to ensure that it works according to the requirement. As the software is developed, JUnit allows regression testing as the test cases is kept in an organized way.  The interface is then tested by using Abbot. The working version is expected to be available at the beginning of week 11. From that point, the build will include the tests and the automated test will be scheduled everyday. As the member develops the code, he or she has the incentive of not to break the build.   
\paragraph{Responsibilites}
Each member is responsible for unit testing his own code. As a component is usually done by more than one member, the component testing, which focus on interfaces is done by that team. Once different versions are integrated, the system testing will be done by the main developers, who include almost all the team members to detect bugs. After that, the QA engineers, which includes Khoi Nguyen, Shikai Li and Jun Chen will do the release testing and ensures that the product meets it requirement.
\paragraph{Schedule}
The testing is supposed to be completed before Monday the 22nd.
\paragraph{Test data}
The test data is generated manually by developers who try normal and exceptional scenarios. The test data is also generated by users who interact with the system.
\paragraph{Testing techniqes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Black-box testing (Partition Testing): Input data and output results often fall into different classes where all members of a class are related. Each of these classes is an equivalence partition or domain where the program behaves in an equivalent way for each class member.  Test cases should be chosen from each partition
	\item White-box testing (Structural Testing): use knowledge of the code to construct test cases. It has different levels of coverage, which is statement coverage (node coverage), branch coverage (edge coverage) and path coverage. White-box testing also includes mutation testing, which effectively test the tests.
