% Introduction %

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose and Scope}
This document is aim to provide information that are required to manage the overall design, implementation, maintenance of the project of archaeology robot. 

This document will be divided in to seven parts, including the Introduction, Definitions, Project organization, Risk management plan, Process model, Work plan, and Supporting plans.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Project organization} describes the responsibilities for each member of the team and the reason behind this arrangement.
	\item \textbf{Risk management} outlines the risks may fond during the developing of the project, also includes risk analysis and the processes and strategies for the team members to control or overcome these risks.
	\item \textbf{Process model} describes the process model will be used throughout the whole development. Including the critical paths and major stages taken in the development. Rational behind this choice will be provided, along with the advantages and disadvantages of this process model. 
	\item \textbf{Work plan} includes the tasks will be done to deliver the product, and the milestones that the team will be meeting during the development. Work plan will also includes the duration of the tasks and the allocation of the resources to these tasks.
	\item \textbf{Supporting plan} will outlines the configuration management plan, the documentation plan, and quality assurance plan.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Assumptions and constraints}
This project will be developed under such assumptions and constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item All the team members will have a computer which installed LejOS.
	\item All the team members' PC will have a JAVA RE and SDK.
	\item All the team members will have access to the group's SVN repository.
	\item A Bluetooth connection can be created between the robot and every team member's PC.
	\item A Lego Mindstorm NXT robot will be used in this project. \\
	\item This project has a duration of 11 weeks.
	\item This project will require at least 10 hours per week workload for each team member.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project deliverables}
The following items will be delivered to the client throughout the development of this project.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Team Poster
	\item Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
	\item Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)
	\item Software Design Document (SDD)
	\item Testing Report
	\item User Manual
	\item Project Milestone Demonstration
	\item Final Project Demonstration
\end{enumerate}


\section{Evolution of the plan}
This plan will be made by the team during the requirements elicitation and system design. The plan shall be made by gathering the feedback from the clients, and negotiation with clients about the milestones. In the software developing stage, the plan shall be changed under such circumstances:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Requirements changed by the clients
	\item A defect of the plan was fond
	\item Other unexpected situations
\end{enumerate}

At the planning stage, client shall be able to change or raise requirements at anytime. However once the plan have been made and the team enter the developing stage, if a change is needed, the client shall negotiate with the project manager along with team members to achieve the changes. 

If a defect of the plan was fond. It will be raised in the group meetings when the whole team shall discuss and respond to the possible changes.

Other unexpected situations such as team member missing and damaged hard drives, will lead to the whole team meeting with the client to discuss how to overcome such situation.

\chapter{Process model}
For this project, the Waterfall Model has been chosen. Waterfall Model is a well known software process model, it has strict deadline which to help the team focus on the software delivery on time. On the other hand, the feature of having stable requirements can be very helpful to the team's development. 

\section{Waterfall Model}

\fbox{\includegraphics[width =0.8\linewidth]{WaterfallModel}}
\caption{The Waterfall Model}
\label{sec:WTF}
\label{fig:WTF}
\end{figure}

The Waterfall Model is a well documented process model, which has more simple approach and disciplined. The waterfall model provides a structured development approach. It includes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Requirements
	\item  Design
	\item  Implementation (Coding or construction of the project)
	\item  Validation (Testing or debugging)
	\item  Maintenance
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Requirements}
At the Requirements specification phase, team will perform requirements elicitation based on the project description and the client meetings. All the selected requirements will be listed in the SRS document and implemented during the development phase.

\paragraph{Design:}
The Design phase is the phase that team members to design and establish a project plan. It is very important for the team to design all the aspects of the project.

\paragraph{Implementation:}
The main developers will start to implementing the software of the project at this phase. Proper SRS documents and plans at earlier phases will be helpful. 

\paragraph{Validation:}
After the implementation is done, the QA engineers will start the Validation phase, involving testing the overall system and ensuring all requirements have being achieved. 

\paragraph{Maintenance:}
After the first release of the software, the team will need to maintain the system and fix possible bugs which would be fond by users.

\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Simple and disciplined linear software process flow.
	\item  Well written documentation will be produced earlier in the software life cycle.
	\item  Software release to the client on deadline.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Not flexible to changing.
	\item  Late discovery of technical problems.
	\item  Can not have working software until the end of the development.
	\item  No testing in the early phases.
\end{enumerate}
